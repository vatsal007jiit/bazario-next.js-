          So often, a drug is marketed only to be withdrawn years later because it has been found unsafe.

          In 1994, farmers began giving diclofenac to their cattle and other livestock. The drug causes kidney
          failure and death in vultures that feed on the carcasses of animals given the painkiller, and the
